# 📚 Android Design Patterns Repository

Welcome to the **Android Design Patterns** repository! This project is a comprehensive learning resource aimed at understanding, implementing, and documenting various design patterns in Android development. The goal is to provide easy-to-understand code examples for each pattern, along with detailed explanations. Additionally, this repository serves as a foundation for writing tech blogs on design patterns.

## 🛠️ Project Purpose

The main objectives of this project are:
- **Learning and Implementing Design Patterns**: Understand how design patterns can be used in Android to write clean, scalable, and maintainable code.
- **Creating a Reference Guide**: Serve as a ready-to-use reference for common design patterns.
- **Tech Blogging**: Share knowledge through a series of blog posts, using this project as a base.

### Branching Strategy

- **master**: Contains a base Android sample app that serves as a foundation for implementing various design patterns.
- **Pattern-Specific Branches**: Each design pattern will have its own branch derived from `master`. This ensures isolation of different pattern implementations.

## 📝 Design Patterns to be Covered

### 1. Creational Patterns
- **Singleton Pattern**: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access.


### 2. Structural Patterns



### 3. Behavioral Patterns
- **Observer Pattern**: Establishes a one-to-many relationship between objects, enabling automatic updates, event listening.
